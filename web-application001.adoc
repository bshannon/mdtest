The firstcup-war Project
------------------------

The `firstcup-war` web application project consists of the Java
Persistence API entity, the enterprise bean, and the JavaServer Faces
web front end.

The `firstcup-war` example application consumes the data from the
`dukes-age` web service using the JAX-RS client API. A JavaServer Faces
web front end asks users to enter their birthdays to find out who is
older, the user or Duke. This data is stored in an Apache Derby database table
using the Java Persistence API. The business logic, which provides the
core functionality of the application, is handled by an enterprise bean.

All the tiers described in link:jakarta-ee001.html#GCRKR[Tiered
Applications] are present in the `firstcup-war` web application. The web
or client tier is the JavaServer Faces front end. The enterprise
information systems, or EIS, tier is the Derby database. The business
tier is the enterprise bean.
